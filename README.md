## Objective:

In this assignment, you will learn how to use the built-in Hashtable class in C# to store and retrieve simple key-value pairs.

## Instructions:

### 1. Create a Console Application:

- Start a new project in Visual Studio and create a Console Application named SimpleHashtable.

### 2. Working with the Hashtable:

- Create a Hashtable object and populate it with some key-value pairs. The key will represent a product name, and the value will represent the stock quantity.
- Use the Add method to insert items into the hashtable.
- Display the contents of the hashtable using a simple loop.
- Demonstrate how to:
  - Check if a product exists in the hashtable using ContainsKey.
  - Retrieve the stock quantity of a product using the product name as the key.

### Steps:

1. Create a Hashtable and add at least 3 items (key-value pairs).
2. Write a method to display all items (keys and values).
3. Use ContainsKey to check if a specific product exists and print a message.
4. Retrieve and print the stock quantity for a product.
